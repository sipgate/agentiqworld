# Project: [PROJECT_NAME]

> **CRITICAL - READ FIRST:**
> - **NEVER run `pocketbase superuser` commands.** The admin account is created by the user during install. If PocketBase shows "create superuser", tell the user to run the install script or create the account manually via `http://localhost:8090/_/`.
> - **NEVER create admin credentials.** Use the existing `POCKETBASE_ADMIN_TOKEN` from environment variables.

> **Welcome Message:** If this file still contains `[PROJECT_NAME]` as the title, this is a fresh clone of the boilerplate. Greet the user warmly, explain this is a vibe coding boilerplate optimized for Claude Code, and offer to run `/setup` to configure their project. Keep it brief and friendly.

## Architecture

Single Node.js process running multiple Express apps on different ports. Memory-efficient design sharing V8 engine and runtime.

## Quick Start After Clone

```bash
# 1. Install and start (creates admin account automatically)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YUZU-Hub/project-boilerplate/main/install.sh | sh -s myproject

# 2. Create the todos collection to activate the example app
cd myproject
claude "Create a todos collection with title, completed, and user fields"

# 3. Visit http://localhost:3001 - register, login, and the todo app works!
```

**What ships vs. what you create:**
- **Ships:** Auth UI, example CRUD code in `webapp/js/app.js`, CSS styles
- **You create:** The `todos` collection (via MCP or migration) - it is NOT created automatically
- The example code shows "Getting Started" instructions until the collection exists

## Development Workflow

### First Session: Check for Dependency Updates

**Before writing any code in a new project**, check that all pinned dependencies are up to date. The boilerplate pins specific versions that may be outdated by the time the project is cloned:

| Dependency | Where it's pinned | How to check latest |
|------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| PocketBase | `Dockerfile` → `POCKETBASE_VERSION` | `gh api repos/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name'` |
| PocketBase JS SDK | `webapp/index.html`, `admin/index.html` → CDN `<script>` tags | `gh api repos/pocketbase/js-sdk/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name'` |
| Node.js | `Dockerfile` → base image `node:XX-alpine` | Check [Node.js releases](https://nodejs.org) |

**Update process:**
1. Check latest versions using the commands above
2. Review changelogs for breaking changes (PocketBase moves fast)
3. Update the pinned versions
4. Rebuild: `docker compose up --build -d`

### Building Features: Specs First

**Always write BDD-style specs before writing implementation code.** This applies to every feature, bug fix, or refactoring task. The workflow is:

1. **Spec** — Write human-readable behavioral specs describing what the feature should do, covering happy paths, edge cases, and error states. Place specs in a `specs/` directory using plain-language `.md` files organized by feature:
   ```
   specs/
   ├── auth/
   │   ├── login.md
   │   └── registration.md
   └── todos/
       ├── create-todo.md
       └── complete-todo.md
   ```
   Each spec file describes scenarios in Given/When/Then format:
   ```markdown
   ## Create a todo
   - Given a logged-in user
   - When they submit a new todo with a title
   - Then the todo appears in their list
   - And other users cannot see it

   ## Reject empty titles
   - Given a logged-in user
   - When they submit a todo with no title
   - Then they see a validation error
   - And no todo is created
   ```

2. **Implement** — Write the minimal code to satisfy the specs:
   - Create PocketBase collections via MCP (requires docker running)
   - Add frontend code to `webapp/` (hot-reloads)
   - Add hooks to `api/pb_hooks/` if needed (requires restart)

3. **Security Review** — Before considering a feature complete, audit the new code against the OWASP Top 10. Check every item below that applies:

   | Check | What to look for |
   |-------|-----------------|
   | **Injection** | Are all PocketBase filters using `api.filter()` with parameters? Any raw SQL, `eval()`, or `new Function()`? |
   | **Broken Auth** | Does the feature respect PocketBase auth rules? Are API rules set on the collection (list/view/create/update/delete)? Can users access other users' data? |
   | **Sensitive Data** | Are secrets in `.env` only (never hardcoded)? Is sensitive data excluded from API responses? Are passwords/tokens ever logged? |
   | **XSS** | Is all user-generated content escaped before rendering? Does any code use `innerHTML`, `document.write`, or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization? |
   | **Broken Access Control** | Do collection rules enforce ownership (e.g., `@request.auth.id = user.id`)? Can unauthenticated users reach protected routes? |
   | **Security Misconfiguration** | Are CORS settings appropriate? Is debug info hidden in production? Are default credentials removed? |
   | **Insecure Dependencies** | Are CDN URLs pinned to specific versions? Run `npm audit` in `server/` if new dependencies were added. |

   **Vibe coding pitfalls** — AI-generated code has specific failure modes. Also check:

   | Check | What to look for |
   |-------|-----------------|
   | **Hallucinated packages** | Does every `<script src="...">` CDN URL and every `require()`/`import` reference a real package? Verify with `curl -sI <url>` for CDN or check npmjs.com. Fake package names are a supply chain attack vector. |
   | **Overly permissive rules to "make it work"** | Did API rules get set to `""` (public) just to stop errors? Every collection rule should be intentional, not a workaround. |
   | **Phantom validation** | Does the code _look_ like it validates input but actually doesn't? Check that validation logic runs server-side (PocketBase rules/hooks), not just client-side JS that can be bypassed. |
   | **Debug/dev leftovers** | Are there `console.log` statements that dump tokens, passwords, or user data? Any test endpoints or commented-out auth checks left behind? |
   | **Slop accumulation** | Was more code generated than needed? Dead code, unused functions, redundant abstractions, and unnecessary files all increase attack surface. Delete what's not used. |
   | **Auth theater** | Does the UI _hide_ buttons/pages from unauthorized users but the underlying API is still wide open? Client-side route guards are UX, not security — the real enforcement is PocketBase collection rules. |
   | **Secrets in generated code** | AI sometimes inlines example tokens, API keys, or placeholder credentials that look fake but get committed. Search for hardcoded strings that look like `sk-`, `pk_`, `Bearer`, base64 blobs, etc. |
   | **Error messages that leak info** | Do error responses include stack traces, file paths, SQL errors, or internal IPs? In production, errors should be generic. |

   If any check fails, fix it before moving on. Document security decisions in the spec file under a `## Security` section.

4. **Verify** — Manually confirm each scenario passes at http://localhost:3001. Update specs with any discovered edge cases.

5. **Iterate** — If requirements change, update the specs first, then the code.

**Why this workflow?** Specs force clarity on what "done" looks like before writing code. Security review catches vulnerabilities before they ship. Together they prevent scope creep, catch edge cases early, and serve as living documentation.

**Important:** Docker must be running before using PocketBase MCP to create collections.

## Ports

| Service | Port | URL |
|---------|------|-----|
| Homepage | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 |
| Webapp | 3001 | http://localhost:3001 |
| Admin | 3002 | http://localhost:3002 |
| PocketBase | 8090 | http://localhost:8090 |
| PocketBase Admin | 8090 | http://localhost:8090/_/ |

## Documentation Lookup

**CRITICAL:** PocketBase evolves rapidly. Before writing ANY PocketBase code, ALWAYS:
1. Use Context7 to fetch the latest docs — never rely on memorized APIs
2. Verify the syntax matches the version pinned in this project (`Dockerfile` and CDN tags)
3. If the pinned version is outdated, flag it to the user and offer to update (see "First Session" above)

**Key docs to check via Context7:**
- PocketBase JS SDK (frontend): authentication, CRUD, realtime, files
- PocketBase JSVM (backend hooks): `$app`, `$http`, event handlers
- Express.js: routes, middleware (for Node.js server)

**CDN links:** Always verify CDN URLs exist before adding them (`curl -sI <url>`). Don't guess URLs — they change between versions.

**Updating PocketBase:** Version is set in `Dockerfile` (`POCKETBASE_VERSION`). JS SDK version is in CDN `<script>` tags. Before updating:
1. Check changelog for breaking changes
2. Review existing hooks/migrations for incompatibilities
3. Verify CDN URL returns HTTP 200
4. Rebuild container and test locally

## MCP Servers

| MCP Server | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `pocketbase` | Database operations |
| `context7` | Documentation lookup |
| `github` | Repo management |

**PocketBase MCP usage:**
- **Use for:** CRUD operations on records, status checks, reading schema info
- **Never for:** Creating or modifying collections - always use migrations instead (they're version controlled and reproducible across environments)

## Custom Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/dev` | Start local development environment |
| `/stop` | Stop all local servers |
| `/db-status` | Check PocketBase health and collections |
| `/setup` | Initial project configuration guide |
| `/deploy` | Manual deployment instructions |
| `/commit` | Create a commit with consistent message format |
| `/migrate` | Guide for migrating existing projects |

## PocketBase Notes

### Reserved System Routes

**NEVER overwrite these routes with custom hooks:**

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/_/*` | Admin dashboard UI |
| `/api/health` | Health check endpoint |
| `/api/collections/*` | Collection schema CRUD |
| `/api/collections/{c}/records/*` | Record CRUD operations |
| `/api/collections/{c}/auth-*` | Authentication endpoints |
| `/api/files/*` | File serving |
| `/api/realtime` | SSE subscriptions |
| `/api/batch` | Batch requests |

**Safe pattern:** Use `/api/custom/` or `/api/myapp/` prefix for custom routes.

### Migrations with Field-Dependent Rules

When creating collections with rules that reference fields (e.g., `@request.auth.id = user.id`), PocketBase v0.23+ validates rules by default before fields are registered.

**Solution: Use `saveNoValidate()`** to bypass validation when rules reference the collection's own fields:

```javascript
migrate((app) => {
  const usersCollection = app.findCollectionByNameOrId("users");
  const collection = new Collection({
    name: "todos",
    type: "base",
    listRule: "@request.auth.id = user.id",
    viewRule: "@request.auth.id = user.id",
    createRule: "@request.auth.id != ''",
    updateRule: "@request.auth.id = user.id",
    deleteRule: "@request.auth.id = user.id",
    fields: [
      { type: "text", name: "title", required: true },
      { type: "bool", name: "completed" },
      { type: "relation", name: "user", collectionId: usersCollection.id, required: true },
      // Always include autodate fields:
      { type: "autodate", name: "created", onCreate: true, onUpdate: false },
      { type: "autodate", name: "updated", onCreate: true, onUpdate: true }
    ]
  });
  app.saveNoValidate(collection);  // Bypasses rule validation
}, (app) => {
  app.delete(app.findCollectionByNameOrId("todos"));
});
```

**Caution:** `saveNoValidate()` skips ALL validation. Ensure your schema is correct before using it. For simple cases, prefer the **PocketBase MCP** which handles this automatically.

### Migration Tracking

**Filename format:** `<unix_timestamp_seconds>_<name>.js` (e.g., `1737451234_create_todos.js`)

**Auto-apply:** PocketBase automatically applies pending migrations on startup. No manual commands needed.

**Checking status:** Migrations that have been applied are tracked in PocketBase's internal `_migrations` table. You can verify applied migrations:
- Check PocketBase startup logs for "Applied migration: ..."
- Query `SELECT * FROM _migrations` in PocketBase Admin SQL console
- If a collection exists with correct schema, the migration ran successfully

**Workflow:**
1. Create migration file in `api/pb_migrations/`
2. Restart PocketBase (or `docker compose restart pocketbase`)
3. Migration applies automatically - check logs to confirm

### Hooks Runtime (GOJA)

Hooks run in **GOJA** (Go-based JS interpreter), not Node.js.

**PocketBase globals:**

| Global | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `$app` | PocketBase application instance |
| `$http` | HTTP client (`$http.send()`) |
| `$os` | OS operations, env vars, shell commands |
| `$security` | JWT, encryption, random strings |
| `$mails` | Email sending |
| `$filesystem` | File operations |
| `$filepath` | Path utilities |
| `$dbx` | Database query builder |
| `$apis` | API routing helpers |
| `$template` | Template rendering |

**Also available:**
- `require()` for local CommonJS modules (not npm)
- `cronAdd()` / `cronRemove()` for scheduled tasks
- `routerAdd()` / `routerUse()` for custom routes
- `sleep()` for delays
- 100+ hook functions (`onRecordCreate`, `onMailerSend`, etc.)

**NOT available:**
- npm packages
- `fetch()` - use `$http.send()` instead
- `async`/`await`, `Promise` - everything is synchronous
- Node.js APIs (`fs`, `buffer`, `crypto`)
- Browser APIs (`window`, `document`)

**Full reference:** https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/index.html

### JS SDK Patterns (Frontend)

**Safe filters:** Never use string interpolation for filters (injection risk). Use `api.filter()`:

```javascript
// BAD - injection risk
filter: `user = "${userId}"`

// GOOD - safe parameterized filter
filter: api.filter('user = {:userId}', { userId: api.currentUser().id })
```

**Auto-cancellation:** PocketBase JS SDK auto-cancels duplicate requests with the same signature. To disable (e.g., for parallel requests):

```javascript
api.list('collection', 1, 20, { requestKey: null })
```

## Hot Reload

- **Static files:** Changes to `homepage/`, `webapp/`, `admin/` are immediate
- **Server code:** Changes to `server/*.js` auto-restart via Node.js `--watch`
- **PocketBase hooks:** Changes to `api/pb_hooks/` require container restart

## Webapp Starter Code

The webapp includes example CRUD code in `webapp/js/app.js` demonstrating:
- List, create, update, delete operations
- Realtime subscriptions for live updates
- User-owned data patterns

This example works with a "todos" collection. **Delete the example sections** (marked with comments) when building your own app.

## Coding Guidelines

- **NEVER create PocketBase superuser/admin accounts.** If you see "create superuser" in logs, tell the user: "PocketBase needs an admin account. Please create one at http://localhost:8090/_/ or re-run the install script." Do NOT run `pocketbase superuser` yourself.
- **Design fresh for each project.** The boilerplate's auth UI and example code are starting points, not templates to copy. Think about what design, layout, and UX patterns best fit the specific project being built.
- Only use PocketBase Authentication. Don't implement auth yourself.
- **Every new collection needs API rules.** Never leave list/view/create/update/delete rules empty (which defaults to superuser-only) or set to `""` (which means public access). Always set explicit rules like `@request.auth.id != ""` or `@request.auth.id = user.id`.
- **Escape all user content before rendering.** Use the `escapeHtml()` helper in `webapp/js/app.js`. Never use `innerHTML` with unescaped user data.
- **Never hardcode secrets.** Tokens, passwords, API keys go in `.env` only. Check that `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
- Update this file when making significant changes to structure or architecture.
